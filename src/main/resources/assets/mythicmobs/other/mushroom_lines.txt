Hello there!
Seen any smurfs lately?
I hate Gargamel...
Mondays huh?
You're a big fellow!
Please don't eat me!
Is it 4:20 already?
Why did the Creeper hang out with me? Because I'm such a fungi to be around!
They say I'm a fun-gi, but I think I'm just a cap-tivating conversationalist!
Looking for a spore-tacular time? You've found the right mushroom!
Did you hear about the fungi who threw a party? It was a real spore-gy!
