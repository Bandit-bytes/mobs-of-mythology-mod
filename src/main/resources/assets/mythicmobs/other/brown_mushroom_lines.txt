Why do I feel like a fun-guy in a no-fun zone?
You want a piece of my spore attitude? Take a hike!
Life's a spore-t, and then you decompose.
Step back, or I'll give you a spore-tacular scowl!
Why do players always pick on mushrooms? Can't we just have a cap-py existence?
I'd rather be left alone in my dark corner. No mushroom for company!
I don't have mushroom for joy, just a whole lot of fung-titude!
Have a fung-tastic day...
I am responsible for the apocalypse.
I'm not grumpy, I'm just a fungi with a perpetual frown.
Why are you bothering me? Can't you see I'm having a spore day?
Why do players keep trying to cheer me up? Do I look like a sunflower to you?
I'm like a mushroom, growing in the darkness of my grumpy thoughts.
Step lightly, or you might awaken the wrath of the grumpy mushroom!
Why be a fun-guy when you can be a grump-guy?
I've mastered the art of being perpetually annoyed. It's my spore-cialty!
Let's get blazed! Go bring the blaze rod.
Is it 4:20 already?
