Seen any smurfs lately?
I hate Gargamel...
Mondays, huh?
You're a big fellow!
Please don't eat me!
Why did the Creeper hang out with me? Because I'm such a fun-gi to be around!
They say I'm a fun-gi, but I think I'm just a cap-tivating conversationalist!
Looking for a spore-tacular time? You've found the right mushroom!
Did you hear about the fungi who threw a party? It was a real spore-gy!
I'm not edibles!
My cousin Brownie is an alchemist.
Do you know of a bard named Mush Mouth? I hear he's an All Star.
I'm not a regular mushroom; I'm a spore-tacular mushroom!
Some people blame me for the apocalypse...
